#Pacman

Written in Python 2.7 using Pygame.

Sounds from [http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/pacman/sounds.php](http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/pacman/sounds.php).

**TODO**:

* Change level parsing code so that paths are only 1 pixel wide, rather than 3 pixels. Change `level1.png` accordingly.  
* Make Pacman sprite better + have transparency
